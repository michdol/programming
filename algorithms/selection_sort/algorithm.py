"""
Consider sorting n numbers stored in array A by first finding the smallest element of A and exchanging it with the
element in A[1].
Then find the second smallest element of A, and exchange it with A[2].
Continue in this manner for the first n - 1 elements of A.

- Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as selection sort.
- What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain?
- Why does it need to run for only the first n - 1 elements, rather than for all n elements?
- Give the best-case and worst-case running times of selection sort in â€šTheta-notation.
